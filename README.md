# traffic_controller
A Verilog-based Traffic Light Controller built and simulated on Xilinx Vivado. Demonstrates FSM-based signal control for intersection management.

This project implements a Traffic Light Controller using Verilog HDL, designed and simulated on Xilinx Vivado. It models a basic traffic signal system using a finite state machine (FSM) approach to control the sequencing of lights at a standard four-way intersection.

âœ… Features:
FSM-based design for traffic signal transitions

Written in behavioral Verilog

Includes testbench for simulation and verification

Simulated and waveform-verified using Vivado

ðŸ’» Tools Used:
Xilinx Vivado for synthesis, simulation, and waveform analysis

ðŸ™Œ Credits:
Special thanks to Arjun Narula, whose original Verilog logic and design structure inspired this project. This implementation adapts and expands upon his version using Vivado tools and testbench customization.
